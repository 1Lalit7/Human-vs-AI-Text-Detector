# Human vs. AI Text Detector

Classifying AI-generated vs. human-written text using traditional ML, sentence embeddings, and deep learning models.


With the rise of AI-generated content, distinguishing human-written text from AI-generated text is becoming crucial for content moderation, plagiarism detection, and misinformation control. This project explores multiple approaches, including traditional ML models, sentence embeddings, and deep learning architectures, to build an effective AI text detector.
